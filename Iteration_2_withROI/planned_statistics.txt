# the purpose of this document is to lay out what statistical tests will be conducted on output measures. 

1) Output measures of interest

- the absolute time spent interacting with each stimulus per minute
- the relative proportion of time spent with the novel stimulus in each video
- the number of interaction bouts per video
- the mean bout duration per video
- the mean bout duration when interacting with the novel stimulus per video

2) Coorelations

- One 4-way coorelation matrix for the absolute amount of time spent interacting with any stimulus per video
- One 4-way coorelation matrix for the relative amount of time spent interacting with the novel stimulus per video

3) Model Comparisons

- Compare each scoring method to gold-standard human scoring by showing the second error per minute graph (instances of certain magnitudes of error)

4) Hypothesis testing

- For each measure of interest, we will conduct a 2-way (or 3-way) ANOVA comparing how measures change between treatment groups, DOT/IOT, and rat sex.
